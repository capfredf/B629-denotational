# B629 Topics in PL: Denotational Semantics

Indiana University, Spring 2018

In this course we shall study the denotational semantics of
programming languages, including the classic domain-theoretic models
as well as elementary models based on functions-as-graphs and
intersection types. The course assignments will include readings from
selected chapters and papers, written homework, presentations, and
some programming.

## Instructor

**Jeremy Siek** LH 230D [jsiek@indiana.edu](mailto:jsiek@indiana.edu)

## Lectures

9:30-10:45am MW in BH 305

The lecture notes are in progress at:

[https://github.com/jsiek/B629-denotational/notes.pdf](notes.pdf).

## Assignments

There will be a homework (reading and some exercises) each week and a
written report and presentations at the end of the semester.  Also,
roughly each week, one student will give a 30 minute presentation of a
paper that the class has read.

- [Homework 1](hw1.md) is due January 15
- [Homework 2](hw2.md) is due January 22. UNDER CONSTRUCTION
