# B629 Topics in PL: Denotational Semantics

Indiana University, Spring 2018

In this course we shall study the denotational semantics of
programming languages, including the classic domain-theoretic models
as well as elementary models based on functions-as-graphs and
intersection types. The course assignments will include readings from
selected chapters and papers, written homework, presentations, and
some programming.
